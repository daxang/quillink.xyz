Quillink is built for story creators and their fans!
core members of quillink ourselves are both story creators and fans. at first, we try to find a web3 story-publish platform to share our stories and derivatives, but we find none.

so, we thought, why not build one by ourselves;

months later, alpha comes out with great helps from great guys.GREAT THANKSTO @Baptiste @Oribs @Ceramic;

and it is a total web3 Dapp.
all data (all data, every chapters of stories, users infos, comments,likes........) stored in ceramic;

only data creators can edit/delete the data;

data belongs to its creators, not Quillink;

what can we do in Quillink now?
